==Note from Author==
F. Maguire was kind enough to set this years ago when I was completely neglecting WoLF PSORT due to various distractions.  Thank you F. Maguire!

He was also kind enough to hand it off to me a while later.
I have seldom updated it, but recently (2023) updated the license to GPLv3 and
added more mention of the large contribution of Kenta Nakai, the original creator of PSORT,
to this project.

START

Please first read this documents:

  ./CITATION
  ./INSTALL


EXECUTION

This package contains two scripts to be directly executed:

  ./bin/runWolfPsortSummary, and ./bin/runWolfPsortHtmlTables


For a simple, text based, summarized prediction result use:

  ./bin/runWolfPsortSummary fungi < ./bin/testQuery.fasta


# NOTE THIS DOESN'T WORK AUTOMATICALLY #
For a more elaborate and informative html version use: 

  ./bin/runWolfPsortHtmlTables fungi testOut/ queryName < ./bin/testQuery.fasta

In this case the results will be written to the directory "testOut/"
(which use should create first, the script will not create it for you.

To view the results point an html browser at testOut/htdocs/results/queryName.html
